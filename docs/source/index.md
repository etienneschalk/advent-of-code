# Advent of Blog

Welcome to this blog!

I try to describe my solutions and struggles that I encountered during the Advent of Code challenge of 2023.

The final goal is to achieve a true multimedia journal with videos, interactive notebooks as well as a comprehensive documentation of the code.

Goals are multiples. They are not achieved at the time of writing, but are written here to set the bar the highest possible.

- Problem-solving sharpening
  - Go beyond the "one-off" Advent of Code problem resolution and build a consistent framework aiming at easing the resolution of future problems, making them documented and reproducible
  - Consolidate my own comprehension of problems ; I won't hide that I more than often got inspiration from the [Advent of Code Reddit forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/)
- Technical improvement
  - Experiment with latest Python features, tools and good practices with full liberty
  - Use this project as a pool of knowledge for potential future usages
- Work on communication
  - How to explain the reasoning behind the solutions of Advent of Code to both a technical and non-technical audience
  - How to provide helpful visualizations of problems
